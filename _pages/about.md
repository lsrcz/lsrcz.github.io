- I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) group at the University of Washington.
- I am fortunate to be advised by [Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/).
- Prior to joining UW, I studied in Peking University. I was lucky to work with [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/) on software engineering.
