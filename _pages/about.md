I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/).

Prior to joining UW, I studied in Peking University. I was lucky to work with [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/) on mutation analysis.
