- I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) group at the University of Washington. I am privileged to be advised by [Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/).
- Prior to joining UW, I did my undergraduate at Peking University. I was very fortunate to be advised by and work with Professor [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/) on software engineering.
- My research interests lie in the general area of programming languages, particularly program synthesis and formal verification.
- My name written in Chinese is 卢思睿. It is pronounced as /lu˨˥/ /sɹ̩˥/ /ʐwei̯˥˨/.
