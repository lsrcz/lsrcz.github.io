- I am a Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI, working at the intersection of AI and formal methods.
- I received my Ph.D. from the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) group at the University of Washington. I am privileged to be advised by [Rastislav Bodík](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/). My research lies in programming languages, with a focus on program synthesis and formal verification.
- Before UW, I completed my undergraduate studies at Peking University, where I worked with [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/) on software engineering.
- My name in Chinese is 卢思睿 (Pinyin: Lú Sīruì; IPA: [lu˧˥ si˥ ɻweɪ˥˩]).
